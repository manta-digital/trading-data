# Changelog

All notable changes to the AI Project Guide system will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.19.2] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed

- `guide.ai-project.005-task-breakdown.md` now explicitly forbids a merge
  step in any task's Success Criteria. The merge belongs to Phase 7 (after
  the code review), which itself expects all Phase 6 tasks already
  complete — a merge task in the last task deadlocks completion, since it
  can never be checked off before the review that depends on it being
  checked off (#26).

## [0.19.1] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed

- `flutter.md` no longer claims `**/*.dart`, `**/pubspec.yaml` and
  `**/analysis_options.yaml` — the same paths `dart.md` already owns. Every
  `.dart` file in a plain Dart project (no Flutter) was attaching Flutter
  widget/navigation/build guidance that didn't apply. `flutter.md` now
  attaches only on `android/**` and `ios/**`, the platform folders unique to
  `flutter create` projects (#13).

## [0.19.0] - 2026-09-25

### Added

- `setup-ide` records the files each target installs in
  `.context-forge/<target>.manifest` (checksum, size, path). Commit it with the
  installed files (#25).

### Changed

- `setup-ide` now deletes files it installed earlier but no longer writes: a
  rule, agent or skill the guide dropped, or a rule newly added to
  `rules.exclude`. A file edited since it was installed is kept, with a warning.
  `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` and `copilot-instructions.md` are never deleted.
  Installs from before the manifest existed also lose the `analyze` skill and
  `code-review-agent.md`, but only when the content matches a version the guide
  shipped (#25).
- Valid `status` values are now listed where agents set status: the per-docType
  schemas, the initiative plan template, and the system prompt (#12).

### Fixed

- `readme.setup-ide.md` described the `cursor` target as installing always-on
  rules and agents under `.cursor/`. Always-on rules go to `AGENTS.md`, and
  agents are not installed.

## [0.18.2] - 2026-09-25

### Changed

- PR review files are named `pr-{number}-review.{reviewType}.md`. In a shared
  reviews directory (`review.external_reviews_dir` or `--reviews-dir`) the name
  also carries the repository: `pr-{number}-review.{reviewType}.{owner}-{repository}.md`.
  Reviews written under the old `{host}-{owner}-{repository}-{number}-review.{reviewType}.md`
  form are not renamed and stay valid.

## [0.18.1] - 2026-09-25

### Changed

- The `copilot` target of `setup-ide` now copies skills to `.agents/skills/` as
  Agent Skills (`<name>/SKILL.md`) instead of translating them into
  `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md`. VS Code has deprecated prompt files, and they
  only worked in the IDE; Copilot reads Agent Skills in the IDE, cloud agent,
  code review and CLI. `.agents/skills/` is the directory the `agents` target
  already writes, so one copy serves Copilot, Codex and Cursor (#24).

  Re-running removes `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md` files that an earlier version
  generated (identified by the `<!-- context-forge:generated -->` stamp), so no
  skill is listed twice. Hand-written prompt files are left alone, and the
  directory is removed only if nothing else is in it.

### Removed

- The `analyze` skill (`project-guides/skills/analyze/`), which is obsolete.
  It was the only shipped skill, so `setup-ide` currently installs no skills on
  any target. Projects that already installed it keep their copy until they
  delete it, because `setup-ide` does not remove files the guide has dropped.

### Fixed

- `readme.setup-ide.md` said the `agents` target writes only `AGENTS.md`. It also
  copies skills to `.agents/skills/`.
- `file-naming-conventions.md` described the pre-0.18.0 managed-file marker. It
  now describes the BEGIN/END region and the `context-forge:generated` stamp.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-09-22

Requires context-forge >= 0.17.0. Older versions recognize only the previous
marker, so they would read every managed file as unmanaged — prompting on each
run and creating backups for files that already have one.

### Changed

- `setup-ide` now merges its generated content into `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`
  and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` instead of overwriting them. Generated
  content is wrapped in `<!-- BEGIN:context-forge -->` / `<!-- END:context-forge -->`
  and only that span is replaced, so hand-written content in those files
  survives a re-run.

  A file that was never managed is now preserved and the block appended, with a
  one-time `.pre-context-forge` backup. Previously such a file was destroyed:
  a project that already had a `CLAUDE.md` before adopting context-forge lost
  it on first run, with nothing recoverable outside git.

  Files carrying the old `[//]: # (context-forge:managed)` marker migrate
  automatically — generated content always ran from that marker to end of file,
  so the span is known without parsing content.

  A file with unbalanced markers is left untouched and the run exits non-zero
  rather than guessing at the boundary.

- Marker syntax moved from `[//]: # (...)` to HTML comments. The link-reference
  form depends on renderers discarding unused link reference definitions, which
  lightweight non-CommonMark parsers get wrong — it leaks as visible text. The
  generated single-file artifacts under `.github/` carry a standalone
  `<!-- context-forge:generated -->` tag rather than a pair, since they have no
  user-authored region to protect.

### Added

- `rules.exclude` — comma-separated basename globs (e.g. `dart.md,swift*.md`)
  naming scoped rules to leave uninstalled, for rules irrelevant to a project.
  Read from the `CONTEXT_FORGE_RULES_EXCLUDE` environment variable as a one-off
  override, otherwise from `cf config`. Unset means every rule is installed, as
  before.

  Skip-only: a new exclusion stops future copies but never deletes a file an
  earlier run installed. Always-on rules cannot be excluded, since they compile
  into the managed block rather than being installed as files.

  A pattern matching nothing warns on stderr without failing the run, naming
  whether it was a typo or a valid always-on rule that cannot be excluded.

## [0.17.10] - 2026-09-19

### Changed

- Added `.gitattributes` with `export-ignore` for paths used only to develop
  the guide itself: `user/`, `.claude/`, `.idea/`, `.obsidian/`,
  `.understand-anything/`, `DEVLOG.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `.gitattributes`.
  They remain tracked here but are left out of `git archive` output, so
  tarball installs no longer carry them into consumer projects (where the
  guide's `user/` sat beside the project's own `project-documents/user/` and
  showed up in PR diffs on every guide update). Submodule and clone installs
  are unchanged.

## [0.17.9] - 2026-09-19

### Added

- `rules/git.md`: "Worktrees" subsection. The target is a property of the
  config, never of the checkout; a registered worktree's
  `git.integration_branch` is its own long-lived branch, giving `main` ←
  integration branch ← worktree branch ← slice branch. Agents merge exactly
  one level (slice into target); everything above is PM-only. Unregistered
  worktrees and a target checked out elsewhere are STOP conditions. Fixes #15.
- `rules/git.md`: explicit merge steps replace the one-line "merges into the
  target" sentence — re-read the target, check it out, merge, STOP on failure.
- `rules/git.md`: "Branch Protection" section. A 404 from the classic
  protection endpoint does not mean a branch is unprotected; agents must also
  check `rules/branches/{branch}` (rulesets) before reporting either way.

## [0.17.8] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- Removed a self-referential submodule: `project-documents/ai-project-guide`
  (a gitlink pointing at this repo's own URL) and `.gitmodules`, both
  introduced by commit `4714fbd` from running `cf guides install` inside a
  checkout of the guide itself. Every consumer install (tarball, submodule,
  clone) was carrying both artifacts. Fixes #21.

## [0.17.7] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- `file-naming-conventions.md`: documents the pull-request review filename
  convention, `{host}-{owner}-{repository}-{number}-review.{reviewType}.md`
  (e.g. `github.com-ecorkran-squadron-42-review.code.md`), as a third
  sibling to Slice-Lineage and Operational Reviews under "Review Files".
  Adds the `targetKind` (`slice`|`arch`|`step`|`pr`, defaults to `slice`)
  and `rulesSource` (`flag`|`config`|`project`|`user`|`template`|`none`)
  optional frontmatter keys, and the `pr:` mapping (`host`, `owner`,
  `repository`, `number`, `url`) that replaces `slice:` for PR reviews.
  Notes that `reviewedSha` is the PR's head sha, not the reviewing
  machine's `HEAD`. Ports a convention already shipped in squadron
  (`383-slice.pr-keyed-review-persistence`).

## [0.17.6] - 2026-09-15

### Added

- `tool-guides/docker/`: a new Docker/container tool guide following the
  `tool-guides/electron/` numbered-file convention — `00-introduction.md`,
  `01-image-and-build.md`, `02-entrypoint-and-process-model.md`,
  `03-compose-and-orchestration.md`, `04-decision-guide.md`. Covers
  containerization decisions that build and start successfully but fail
  quietly: multi-mode entrypoint dispatch (reject unknown modes rather than
  defaulting), PID 1 zombie reaping and signal forwarding, loopback binds
  not surviving containerization, gitignored env files under `set -e`,
  build-time vs. runtime work, pinning for reproducibility, `depends_on`
  vs. real health gating, graceful stop windows, and porting an existing
  systemd unit's tuning into a container. Closes #20.

## [0.17.5] - 2026-09-14

The Phase 4 slice-design template becomes a file and a schema, and gains a
validator, so body structure is enforced mechanically rather than by prose.

### Added

- `project-guides/templates/slice-design.md`: the canonical slice-design
  template as a real file with `{placeholder}` substitution points. Each
  heading carries a marker: `<!-- required -->` (must appear at the same level
  with the same text) or `<!-- optional: ... -->` (omit when the stated
  condition applies). Unmarked level-3 headings are guidance and may be
  renamed or dropped, so legitimate omission stays legal and "Template
  Stuffing" remains an anti-pattern.
- `scripts/validate-slice-design`: checks one or more slice-design documents
  for every heading the template marks required. Prints `PASS` or `FAIL` with
  the missing headings; exit 0 pass, 1 fail, 2 usage or template error.
  Lenient matching (case, whitespace, parenthetical suffixes, fenced blocks
  skipped); requires `docType: slice-design` in frontmatter. Bash 3.2
  compatible. The template itself and a real conforming design both pass.

### Changed

- `guide.ai-project.004-slice-design.md`: the inline template blocks are
  replaced by a pointer to the template file and the required/optional
  contract; the Design Review Checklist and Phase 4 Success Criteria now
  require a passing validator run.
- `prompt.ai-project.system.md` (Phase 4): instructs writing from the
  template file and running the validator before finishing.
- `guide.ai-project.process.md` (Phase 4), `file-naming-conventions.md`
  (slice-design schema), `project-guides/readme.md`, and root `readme.md`
  point at the template and validator.

Context Forge boundary: `cf validate frontmatter` still checks YAML only and
`cf check` only that a design exists. Invoking this validator from `cf`, or
reading the `<!-- required -->` markers natively, is context-forge work.

## [0.17.4] - 2026-09-09

### Added

- Guidance that `review: none` in slice-design frontmatter is a Project
  Manager decision only. It is Context Forge's review-exempt declaration and
  clears every slice-scoped review gate (slice, tasks, code) for that slice.
  Agents must not add it, must not run `cf check --set-review-none`, and must
  not carry it over when using an earlier slice design as a format template.
  When `cf next` reports a required review, the correct action is to stop and
  tell the Project Manager or run the review via the project's review process,
  never to edit frontmatter. Added to `guide.ai-project.004-slice-design.md`
  (frontmatter template), `file-naming-conventions.md` (slice-design schema),
  and `guide.ai-project.process.md` (Phase Approval). Motivated by two
  real failures in context-forge where an agent set the field to bypass a
  review gate and a later design inherited it by copying frontmatter.

## [0.17.3] - 2026-09-09

### Added

- Root `readme.md` now carries a callout stating that, once installed into a
  consuming project, `project-documents/ai-project-guide/` is managed by
  Context Forge (`cf`) and overwritten on `cf guides update` — customizations
  belong under `project-documents/user/` instead. Also notes that projects
  whose CI checks out this repo as a submodule need `submodules: recursive`
  on their checkout step. Closes #19.

## [0.17.2] - 2026-08-05

Two rule additions, both distilled from real failures where a tool read
configuration from the wrong universe.

### Added

- `rules/python.md` — "one value, one source" configuration rule: `os.environ`
  and the pydantic settings object are different sources of truth, and `.env`
  values loaded by settings are not visible to `os.environ.get()`. Code that
  reads configuration must go through the settings object, or it silently
  reads an empty universe and fails without error.
- `rules/sql.md` — destructive and maintenance tooling (restore, rechunk,
  repair) must take its DB URL from an explicit caller argument, never from
  ambient environment inside the tool, and must refuse to run when the target
  does not match the expected database signature. A restore aimed by an unset
  variable is the same failure mode the tool exists to repair.

## [0.17.1] - 2026-08-05

Production database protection rules land, and the legacy code-review
cluster (superseded by squadron) is removed.

### Added

- Production database protection rules, distilled from a real incident (a test
  fixture handed production credentials truncated prod tables while its suite
  reported green). Full rule set in `rules/sql.md` ("Production Database
  Protection"); test-facing subset in `rules/testing.md` ("Database Safety in
  Tests"); always-on summary line in `rules/general.md` so the protection
  applies even when no SQL or test file is in scope.

### Removed

- The legacy code-review cluster, superseded by squadron and Claude Code's
  built-in review commands:
  - `project-guides/guide.ai-project.090-code-review.md`
  - `project-guides/prompt.code-review-crawler.md` (dangling since 0.16.0 —
    its questionnaire source `rules/review.md` was removed then)
  - `project-guides/agents/code-review-agent.md` and
    `code-review-config.json` (both pointed at the deleted
    `.cursor/rules/review.md`, and the config still wrote to the pre-rename
    `project-documents/our-project/` path)
  - `.claude/agents/code-review-agent.md` (installed copy)
  - References cleaned from `project-guides/readme.md`,
    `guide.ai-project.process.md`, `file-naming-conventions.md`,
    `readme.setup-ide.md`, `scripts/rename-private-to-user-in-repo.sh`, and
    `scripts/template-stubs/prompt.legacy-migration.md`. The 090-099
    specialized-guide range in `file-naming-conventions.md` is unchanged;
    its example is now `091-legacy-task-migration`.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-08-04

Always-on rules converge on `AGENTS.md` across targets, and the scoped-rule
index is emitted only where nothing else scopes rules.

### Added
- `setup-ide agents` now copies skills to `.agents/skills/` when a skills source is present. The source layout (`<name>/SKILL.md`) already matches the destination, so the copy needs no translation

### Changed
- `setup-ide cursor`: always-on rules are written to `AGENTS.md` instead of `.cursor/rules/`; `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` now carries only the scoped rules. A `.mdc` written by a prior run for a rule that is now always-on is removed, matched by source filename stem so the cleanup can only remove what a previous run wrote from that same source
- `setup-ide cursor` no longer writes `.cursor/agents/`. An existing directory is left in place with a warning rather than deleted — those files carry no managed marker, so the script cannot tell its own past output from user content
- The scoped-rule index in `AGENTS.md` is now emitted only by the `agents` target. The index exists because the `AGENTS.md` format has no `applyTo`/`globs` mechanism; `copilot` (`.github/instructions/` with `applyTo`) and `cursor` (`.cursor/rules/` with `globs`) already deliver scoped rules with working scoping, so a third copy pointing at source paths added nothing
- Copilot setup notes now state that `AGENTS.md` mirrors `copilot-instructions.md`, so enabling VS Code's experimental `chat.useAgentsMdFile` setting loads the same always-on rules twice

### Fixed
- `copy_skills` reported `.claude/skills/` as the destination regardless of where it actually copied. Harmless while only the `claude` target called it, wrong once the `agents` target did too; it now reports the real target directory. Its "not a skill" warning is likewise no longer worded as Claude-specific

## [0.16.1] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed
- Rules: `general.md` Project Navigation now points modular rules at `project-documents/ai-project-guide/project-guides/rules/`, the path that resolves in an installed project. The bare `project-guides/rules/` resolved only inside this repository, so every consumer carried a broken cross-reference — while the two neighboring lines in the same section already used the installed path. No functional impact: every target delivers scoped rules through a mechanism that does not consult this line (`.claude/rules/`, `.github/instructions/` with `applyTo:`, the `AGENTS.md` index, or Cursor `globs:`), so the line was a redundant cross-reference rather than a load path

### Added
- `readme.md`: "Working inside this repository" section for contributors. Guide paths are written for the installed layout, so working in this repo directly requires stripping the `project-documents/ai-project-guide/` prefix; includes a mapping table and a reminder that rules are edited at `project-guides/rules/` while `setup-ide` compiles the generated artifacts

## [0.16.0] - 2026-07-30

Official OpenAI Codex support via a vendor-neutral `AGENTS.md` target, plus a
round of cleanups to the rules/skills pipeline and the docs describing it.

### Added
- `setup-ide agents` target: writes `AGENTS.md` and nothing else — no `.github/` tree, no vendor-specific files. Aliases `openai` and `codex` normalize to it, since `AGENTS.md` is a vendor-neutral format and the target is named after the format rather than one vendor (#7)
- `AGENTS.md` now indexes the scoped (non-`alwaysApply`) rules by path instead of omitting them. The format has no `applyTo`/`paths` scoping mechanism, so inlining them would put Python rules in front of a React project; the index points at the paths they already occupy in the consuming repo, for the agent to read on demand
- `AGENTS.md` now opens with a `# Project Guidelines` heading, matching `CLAUDE.md`'s structure

### Changed
- Extracted `compile_copilot_always_on` into a vendor-neutral `compile_always_on_rules`, now shared by the `copilot` and `agents` targets. `.github/copilot-instructions.md` output is byte-identical to before; `AGENTS.md` is no longer a blind `cp` of it

### Removed
- `project-guides/skills/review.md`: its 12 checklist categories duplicated the Code Review Questionnaire in `guide.ai-project.090-code-review.md` verbatim, and its file-naming section had drifted from the canonical spec — it taught `nnn-review.{name}.md` where `file-naming-conventions.md` defines `nnn-review.{template}.{slice-name}.md`. Had zero inbound references, and was frontmattered `name: review-rules` (a rules file misfiled as a skill). Structured review now lives in squadron and in Claude Code's built-in review commands
- `project-guides/skills/ui-development.md`: a lossy 29-line restatement of `guide.ui-development.ai.md`, which is the copy actually referenced from the process guide. Zero inbound references, and frontmattered `layer: rules` — also misfiled as a skill. Its accessibility guidance was grafted into the guide first, since the guide lacked it

### Fixed
- `copy_skills` now warns when it encounters a flat `.md` in `skills/`. Claude Code requires `<name>/SKILL.md`, so the directory-only glob silently dropped flat files from Claude installs — `review.md` and `ui-development.md` reached Copilot as prompts but never reached Claude, with no indication either was skipped
- `guide.ui-development.ai.md`: replaced Obsidian `![[...]]` embeds with standard markdown image links, so the two mockup figures render on GitHub and in any markdown viewer rather than only in Obsidian. Renamed the images from `Pasted image <timestamp>.png` to descriptive names and added substantive alt text
- Docs: removed the `windsurf` target from `readme.md`, `project-guides/readme.md`, and `snippets/npm-scripts.ai-support.json.md`. The target was removed from the script some time ago, so all three were documenting a command that exits non-zero
- Docs: rewrote `readme.setup-ide.md`, which documented only `cursor`/`windsurf`, described the frontmatter contract as `globs:` (sources use `paths:`), and listed a stale rules inventory. Now covers all four targets, what each writes, and the real frontmatter translation per target

## [0.15.14] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed
- `scripts/setup-ide`: replaced all nine `((var++))` increments with `var=$((var + 1))`. Under `set -e`, `((var++))` exits non-zero when the pre-increment value is `0`, so the script aborted silently on the first counted file — modular rule copying stopped after `dart.md` (the first non-`alwaysApply` rule alphabetically), and agents, skills, and the completion notes were skipped entirely. `cf setup-ide` surfaced this only as a bare non-zero exit with no output. Affected every project running `cf init` (squadron issue #46)
- `scripts/setup-ide`: `copy_skills` now uses `cp -R` and skips empty skill directories explicitly, instead of a `2>/dev/null`-suppressed `cp` that would abort the script under `set -e` for an empty skill directory or any skill containing a subdirectory
- `scripts/rename-private-to-user-in-repo.sh`: same `((UPDATED_COUNT++))` / `set -e` abort on the first updated file

## [0.15.13] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed
- Rules: split the "before starting work" checklist into two clearly labeled paths (planning: commit directly to the target; slice: full branch-management steps) — the merged numbering had led an agent to conclude slice-branch steps might also apply to planning work

### Added
- Tool guides: TimescaleDB guide set (overview, chunk sizing, restructuring, continuous aggregates, query discipline)

## [0.15.12] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed
- Rules: `git.integration_branch` no longer prefixes work branch names — branch names stay `{index}-{type}.{name}` regardless of whether the integration branch is set; only the fork point and merge target change
- Repo: synced root `CLAUDE.md` and the submodule's own `CLAUDE.md`/`git.md` copies with the corrected Branch Naming rules, eliminating drift across the four copies

## [0.15.11] - 2026-07-11

### Changed
- Rules: replaced `git.branch_root` with `git.integration_branch` in Branch Naming — the new key changes fork/merge topology (work forks from and merges into the integration branch, not `main`), not just the branch name prefix
- Rules: removed the `{index}-planning.{name}` branch type; planning work (Phases 0–5) now commits directly to the current integration target instead of a dedicated planning branch
- Repo: synced the root `CLAUDE.md` Branch Naming section with `project-guides/rules/git.md` to eliminate drift

## [0.15.10] - 2026-07-05

### Changed
- Guides: aligned slice status enum in `prompt.ai-project.system.md` and `guide.ai-project.process.md` with the canonical definition in `file-naming-conventions.md`
- Repo: added `.understand-anything/` knowledge graph artifacts and `.gitignore` rules to exclude its scratch/trash directories

## [0.15.9] - 2026-06-30

### Changed
- Rules: Git branch lifecycle now instructs not to delete branches unless specifically instructed to

## [0.15.8] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- Rules: Optional `git.branch_root` config prefix for work branch names (`cf config get git.branch_root`) — prepends a configured root as `{root}/{branch-name}`; affects the git branch name only, not document layout

## [0.15.7] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- Rules: Dart language coding standards (`project-guides/rules/dart.md`) and Flutter application standards (`project-guides/rules/flutter.md`)
- Tool guides: Flutter-on-iOS guide set (`tool-guides/flutter-ios/`) — a path-selecting introduction over a shared `setup/` core (design, build, testing) and a `migration/` path (Android-to-iOS overview, plugin audit), supporting both greenfield iOS apps and Android-to-iOS migrations

## [0.15.6] - 2026-06-28

### Changed
- Rules: Expanded git branch naming rules to cover planning work (`{index}-planning.{name}`) in addition to slice branches

## [0.15.5] - 2026-06-28

### Changed
- Docs: Updated `001-concept` references to `000-concept` across prompts, guides, and conventions per phase renumbering

## [0.15.4] - 2026-04-19

### Changed
- Rules: Added exception handling rule to general.md (Python-specific details in python.md)
- Rules: Python — require ruff/pyright config blocks in pyproject.toml, tighten exception handling, add load-test tier, async blocking rule, and concurrency/shared-state discipline

## [0.15.3] - 2026-04-13

### Changed
- Prompts: Hardened task-checker delegation language in Phase 6, Maintenance Routine, and Phase 6 Notes — prescriptive instead of optional
- Rules: Updated general rules to prescribe task-checker delegation for checklist updates

## [0.15.2] - 2026-04-12

## [0.15.1] - 2026-04-11

### Changed
- Rules: Add hallucination trap guideline to general rules; fix heading levels in parsing section

## [0.14.7] - 2026-03-30

### Changed
- Rules: Added evidence-first debugging rule to general rules — require actual error before attempting fixes

## [0.13.20] - 2026-03-20

### Changed
- Prompts: Phase 6 now specifies `workflow_check`/`cf check` with fix parameter as post-implementation step

## [0.13.19] - 2026-03-18

### Changed
- Prompts: Phase 2 guard clause strengthened — worktree name no longer implies component, explicit PM confirmation required

## [0.13.18] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- File naming: Index-matched review artifact conventions (slice-lineage and operational reviews)

### Changed
- Prompts: Phase 2 now requires agent to confirm architecture goal with PM when not specified
- File naming: Clarified 900-939 range as ad-hoc reviews; slice-lineage reviews use parent index

## [0.13.17] - 2026-03-18

### Changed
- Prompts: Phase 2 (Architecture) prompt adds worktree context block with pre-resolved index and naming

## [0.13.16] - 2026-03-17

### Changed
- Prompts: Phase 2 (Architecture) prompt now includes explicit steps for determining component name and base index
- Prompts: Clarified index scanning, valid range, and reserved range in Phase 2

## [0.13.15] - 2026-03-13

### Changed
- Prompts: Removed `status` field from architecture YAML frontmatter template
- Prompts: Added directive to register architecture document via `cf set arch <nnn>` after creation

## [0.13.14] - 2026-03-13
