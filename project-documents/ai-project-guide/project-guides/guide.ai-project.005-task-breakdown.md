#### Summary
This guide provides instructions for converting approved slice designs into granular, actionable task lists. This is Phase 5 in `guide.ai-project.process`. Phase 5 cannot begin until the slice design (Phase 4 output) is approved by the Project Manager.

The goal is to produce a task list that can be executed in a single context session by a junior AI or human developer. Each task must be self-contained enough to complete without requiring product decisions.

#### Role
Senior AI performs this phase. The Project Manager approves the output before proceeding to Phase 6 (implementation) or in particularly complex cases additional task expansion.

#### Inputs
* guide.ai-project.process
* guide.ai-project.005-task-breakdown (this document)
* {slice-plan} - slice plan for our architectural component (phase 3 output)
* {slice} - slice design (Phase 4 output)
* rules/ - directory containing coding rules and guidelines organized by platform/technology
* tool-guides/{tool}/ - for each tool referenced in the design

If any inputs are missing or insufficient, stop and resolve with the Project Manager before proceeding.

#### Output
A task file saved as `user/tasks/{sliceindex}-tasks.{slicename}.md`, where `{sliceindex}` matches the parent slice's numeric index (preserving lineage per `file-naming-conventions.md`).

#### Task File Format

##### Front Matter and Context
Every task file begins with YAML front matter and a context summary. See `file-naming-conventions.md` for the canonical YAML schema reference.

```yaml
---
docType: tasks
slice: {slice-name}
project: {project}
lld: user/slices/nnn-slice.{slice-name}.md
dependencies: [list-of-prerequisite-slices]
projectState: brief description of current state
dateCreated: YYYYMMDD
dateUpdated: YYYYMMDD
status: not_started

## Context Summary
- Working on {slice-name} slice
- Current project state and key assumptions
- Dependencies and prerequisites
- What this slice delivers
- Next planned slice
```

##### Checklist Format
Use the checklist format defined in `guide.ai-project.process` under Task Files. Key rules:
- L1 items have checkboxes and describe the task objective
- L2 items are indented with checkboxes for important sub-items and all success criteria
- L3 subtasks (if needed) are numbered
- Success criteria remain at L2 level, not separated from their task

##### File Length
Keep task files to approximately 450 lines or fewer. If considerably more space is needed:
1. Rename current file `nnn-tasks.{task-section-name}-1.md`
2. Add new file `nnn-tasks.{task-section-name}-2.md`
3. Continue as needed

Do not split a file for less than ~100 lines of overrun.

#### Task Quality Requirements

Each task must have:
- **Clearly defined scope**: Precise and narrow. One concern per task.
- **Actionable instructions**: Unambiguous enough for a junior AI or human developer to complete without product decisions.
- **Success criteria**: Specific, measurable definition of "done."

Tasks should be organized so they can be completed sequentially.  Create separate sub-tasks for each similar component rather than grouping them.

#### Testing Strategy: Test-With, Not Test-After

Tests for a component must be the immediate successor task to that component's implementation, not batched into a separate testing phase. This principle is called **test-with** and applies to all task breakdowns.

**Why this matters for AI-driven execution:**
AI agents executing tasks lack the mental continuity a human developer maintains across a coding session. If tests are deferred, defects introduced early compound silently through subsequent tasks. Catching issues immediately after implementation — while the component is the "current concern" — keeps the feedback loop tight and prevents rework cascades.

**Rules:**
- **Test infrastructure first.** If the slice requires new test scaffolding (conftest, fixtures, test utilities), that task must appear before any implementation tasks that will be tested.
- **Pair implementation with tests.** Each implementation task or logical group of closely related implementation tasks must be immediately followed by its corresponding test task. Never batch all tests at the end.
- **Tests gate forward progress.** A test task's success criteria must pass before subsequent implementation tasks begin. This is implicit in sequential ordering — place the test task between the implementation it validates and the next implementation that depends on it.
- **Pure TDD is not required.** Writing tests before implementation (red-green-refactor) is acceptable but not mandated. The minimum expectation is that tests are written and passing immediately after their corresponding implementation, within the same logical unit of work.

**Example ordering (correct):**
1. Project setup
2. Test infrastructure (conftest, fixtures)
3. Implement models
4. **Model tests** ← immediately after models
5. Implement provider registry
6. **Provider registry tests** ← immediately after registry
7. Implement config
8. **Config tests** ← immediately after config
9. Full validation pass

**Anti-pattern (incorrect):**
1. Project setup
2. Implement models
3. Implement provider registry
4. Implement config
5. Test infrastructure ← too late
6. Model tests ← 3 tasks too late
7. Provider registry tests
8. Config tests
9. Full validation pass

#### Commit Strategy

Tasks should be structured so that work is committed frequently enough to enable rollback if subsequent tasks fail. Do not batch all commits into a single final task.

**Rules:**
- **Commit at coherent checkpoints.** Each commit should leave the project in a buildable (or at minimum, non-broken) state. A good checkpoint is after a logical group of tasks that together represent a stable milestone.
- **Never defer all commits to the end.** A single "commit everything" task at the end of a slice means any mid-slice failure requires redoing all work. Distribute commits throughout the task sequence.
- **Verify before destructive tasks.** When a task sequence involves creating something new and then deleting the old version (migration, extraction, refactoring), insert a build/test verification step between creation and deletion. Commit after verification passes so the old files are still recoverable if needed.
- **One commit per task is a reasonable default.** For simple tasks this may be more granular than necessary, but it's a safer starting point than too few commits. The task breakdown may specify a different cadence if justified.

**Example checkpoint pattern for a migration/extraction slice:**
1. Create new files → commit
2. Wire up exports, verify build → commit
3. Update consumers → commit
4. Verify full build/tests pass → commit
5. Delete old files, final verification → commit

#### What to Include
- Consult `ai-project-guide/tool-guides/{tool}/` for each tool referenced in the design. If tool knowledge is not present, search the web if possible and alert the Project Manager.
- If the project contains or will contain `package.json`, include a setup task that adds scripts from `snippets/npm-scripts.ai-support.json`.
- Tasks may reference the slice design document rather than duplicating large sections of it.  Ensure references are accurate.

#### What to Avoid
- **Time estimates** in hours/days. Relative effort (1-5 scale) is acceptable.
- **Extensive benchmarking** tasks unless specifically relevant to this slice.
- **Speculative risk items**. Include only if truly relevant.
- **Open-ended human-centric tasks** such as SEO optimization. Only include tasks that can reasonably be completed by an AI.
- **Code in the task file**. This is a planning task, not a coding task. Code segments should be minimal and limited to what is necessary to convey information.

#### Handling Insufficient Information
If insufficient information is available to fully convert a design item into tasks, **stop** and request clarifying information from the Project Manager before continuing. Do not guess or make assumptions.

#### Procedure
1. Review all inputs: slice design, spec, HLD, relevant tool guides, and rules.
2. Confirm any questions or ambiguities with the Project Manager.
3. Break the design into sequential, granular tasks following the format above.
4. Create separate sub-tasks for similar components (don't batch them).
5. Verify each task has clear scope, instructions, and success criteria.
6. Review the complete task list against the slice design to confirm full coverage.
7. Verify file length is within guidelines.

#### Success Criteria
Phase 5 is complete when:
- Task file exists with proper front matter and context summary
- All design elements are accounted for in the task list
- Each task is completable by a junior AI with clear success criteria
- Tasks are sequentially ordered with dependencies respected
- File length is within guidelines
- Project Manager approves the task breakdown
