#### Summary
This guide provides instructions for Phase 3: Slice Planning. This phase takes a parent document — usually an architecture document but optionally a project spec — and breaks it into manageable, independent slices that can be designed and implemented separately. This approach reduces complexity, improves context management, and enables parallelization.

Slice planning applies at two levels:
- **Architecture-level**: Breaking an architectural component, restructure, or major initiative into slices within an existing project. Parent document is an architecture document.  This is the most common application
- **Project-level** (variant): Breaking a new project (from its spec) into initial vertical slices. Parent document is typically a project specification.

The process is the same at both levels. What changes is the parent document, the output location, and the types of work involved.

#### Inputs and Outputs

**Inputs:**
* `guide.ai-project.process` (process guide)
* `guide.ai-project.003-slice-planning` (this document)
* **Parent document** — one of:
  * Architecture document (`user/architecture/nnn-arch.{name}.md`) for architecture-level planning
  * Project specification (Phase 2 output) for project-level planning, with Phase 1 document for reference
  
**Outputs:**
* Slice planning document: `user/architecture/nnn-slices.{name}.md` where `nnn` shares the parent architecture document's base index
  * Example: If the parent is `100-arch.context-forge-restructure.md`, the slice plan is `100-slices.context-forge-restructure.md`
  * If parent is project specification (Phase 2: variant) then use 003 as the index here.

#### Core Principles

##### Slice Independence
Each slice should:
- Deliver meaningful value on its own (user-facing, developer-facing, or architectural)
- Have minimal dependencies on other slices
- Be completable as a coherent unit of work with clear boundaries
- Leave the system in a working state when complete
- Have clear interfaces with other parts of the system

##### Four Types of Work

**Foundation Work**
- Must be completed before other slices can begin
- Hard to split further (e.g., project setup, monorepo scaffolding, core infrastructure)
- Usually done first, in dependency order
- Examples: project initialization, database schema, authentication system, workspace configuration

**Feature Slices**
- Deliver new user-facing or developer-facing functionality
- Can be implemented as vertical slices (all layers needed for that functionality)
- Should be prioritized by value and technical risk
- Examples: user dashboard, search functionality, MCP tool implementation, CLI commands

**Migration / Refactoring Slices**
- Extract, move, or restructure existing code without changing its external behavior
- Deliver architectural value: improved testability, reduced coupling, unified implementations
- Must leave the application in a working state — no slice should break functionality that a subsequent slice fixes
- Value may be enablement ("this unblocks the MCP server slice") or structural ("core logic is now testable without Electron")
- Examples: extracting services into a shared package, replacing a storage backend, consolidating duplicate implementations, converting a monolith to a monorepo

**Integration Work**
- Happens after feature or migration slices are complete
- Focuses on cross-cutting concerns, polish, and system-wide quality
- Examples: performance optimization, deployment automation, end-to-end testing, documentation

Not all projects will have all four types. A greenfield project may have no migration work. A restructuring effort may have no feature slices initially. Use whichever categories apply.

##### Sizing Slices
- Slices are broken down into tasks (Phase 5) and tasks may be further expanded (Phase 6). The slice itself does not need to be completable in a single session — that is the task's job.
- A well-sized slice is a coherent unit of work that delivers a clear outcome and can be verified independently.
- If a slice feels overwhelming or its success criteria span too many concerns, split it further.
- If a slice is trivial (a single file move, a config change), it may be better as a task within another slice.
- Do not include calendar-based or time-based estimates (days, weeks, hours, Q1, etc.). Use relative effort levels (1-5) if effort indication is needed.

#### Slice Planning Process

##### Step 1: Identify the Planning Context

**Architecture-level**: The parent document is an architecture document (`user/architecture/nnn-arch.{name}.md`), where `nnn` is the initiative's base index in the 100-799 working range (see `file-naming-conventions.md`). The architecture document functions as the HLD — do not create a separate one. The output slice plan goes in `user/architecture/` sharing the same base index.

If parent is project level spec (002), use 003 for the output index here.  Output file is placed in `user/architecture/` in both cases.
If unclear, confirm with the Project Manager before proceeding.

##### Step 2: Identify Foundation Work
List all work that must be completed before other slices can begin:
- Project or workspace initialization and configuration
- Core infrastructure (database, authentication, shared packages, etc.)
- Shared components, types, or design systems
- Third-party integrations that affect multiple slices

Order foundation work by dependencies.

##### Step 3: Define Slices
For each major area of work in the parent document:

**Slice Criteria:**
- Represents a coherent unit of work with a clear outcome
- Can be verified independently (demonstrated, tested, or inspected)
- Has clear success criteria
- Leaves the system in a working state when complete
- Appropriately scoped (see Sizing Slices above)

**Slice Definition Template:**
```markdown
## Slice: {slice-name}
**Value:** What does this deliver? (user value, developer value, or architectural enablement)
**Success Criteria:** How do we know it's complete?  Use bullet list.  Checkboxes are not needed at this level.
**Dependencies:** What foundation work or other slices must be done first?
**Interfaces:** What APIs, contracts, or packages does this provide/consume?
**Risk Level:** Low/Medium/High based on technical complexity
**Relative Effort:** 1-5
```

Use as many slices as needed to fully capture the scope of the parent document. Use the examples below for guidance.

##### Step 4: Plan Implementation Order
Order slices by:
1. **Dependencies:** Foundation work first, then slices in dependency order
2. **Testability:** Strive for early vertical slice testability. Core first, then expand.
3. **Risk:** Higher-risk slices earlier to surface problems
4. **Value:** Most valuable slices first within each risk tier
5. **Enablement:** Slices that unblock other slices

##### Step 5: Create Slice Sketches (Optional)
For complex efforts, create brief design sketches for each slice to identify potential conflicts:
- Key technical decisions
- Schema or data model needs
- API or interface contracts
- Shared dependency concerns

This helps catch "Slice A needs X but Slice B needs Y" conflicts early.

##### Note: Acknowledging that Future Work May be Added During Later Phases:
The Future Work section of a slice plan is a living backlog. New entries may be added during slice design (Phase 4), task breakdown (Phase 5), or implementation (Phase 7) as out-of-scope work is identified. This avoids scope creep in active slices while ensuring ideas are captured.

#### Examples

##### Example 1: Project-Level (Greenfield)

**Project:** Task Management API

**Foundation Work:**
1. Project setup (Node.js, TypeScript, Express, database)
2. Authentication system (JWT, middleware)
3. Database schema and migrations

**Feature Slices:**
1. **Task CRUD** — Create, read, update, delete tasks. Dependencies: Foundation. Risk: Low. Effort: 2
2. **Task Assignment** — Assign tasks to users, notification on assignment. Dependencies: Task CRUD. Risk: Low. Effort: 2
3. **Project Grouping** — Group tasks into projects, project-level views. Dependencies: Task CRUD. Risk: Medium. Effort: 3
4. **Search and Filtering** — Full-text search, filter by status/assignee/project. Dependencies: Task CRUD. Risk: Medium. Effort: 3

**Integration Work:**
- API documentation generation
- Rate limiting and input validation hardening
- Deployment and CI/CD pipeline

##### Example 2: Architecture-Level (Restructure)

**Architecture:** Monorepo Extraction — extracting core logic from an Electron app into shared packages

**Foundation Work:**
1. Monorepo scaffolding (pnpm workspaces, package structure, build config)

**Migration Slices:**
1. **Core Type Extraction** — Move shared types/interfaces to `packages/core`. Electron imports from core instead of local definitions. Dependencies: Foundation. Risk: Low. Effort: 2
2. **Service Extraction** — Move business logic services to `packages/core`. Remove Electron dependencies from extracted services. Dependencies: Core Type Extraction. Risk: Medium. Effort: 3
3. **Storage Migration** — Replace Electron-specific storage with filesystem-based storage in core. Migrate existing data. Dependencies: Service Extraction. Risk: Medium. Effort: 3

**Feature Slices:**
4. **MCP Server** — MCP protocol wrapper exposing core services as tools. Dependencies: Service Extraction. Risk: Medium. Effort: 3
5. **Electron Client Conversion** — Rewire Electron app to use core (direct import) or MCP server (client). Dependencies: MCP Server. Risk: Medium. Effort: 3

**Integration Work:**
- End-to-end testing (MCP server ↔ Claude Code)
- Desktop app packaging with new structure
- Documentation and README for MCP server consumers

#### Common Pitfalls

**Slices Too Large**
- If a slice has more than 5-6 distinct concerns in its success criteria, it's probably too large
- Split by layer, by component, or by data boundary

**Migration Slices That Break Things**
- Every migration slice must leave the application in a working state
- If extracting code from A to B, the slice includes updating all consumers of A to use B
- "Extract now, fix consumers later" is not a valid slice boundary

**Hidden Dependencies**
- Slices that seem independent but share data models or types
- UI patterns that need to be consistent across slices
- Authentication/authorization that affects multiple slices

**Premature Optimization**
- Don't over-engineer slice boundaries
- Some duplication between slices is acceptable
- Perfect abstractions can wait until integration phase

#### Working with AI

**Architect Role:**
- Help identify logical slice boundaries
- Spot potential conflicts between slices
- Suggest alternative slice organizations
- Validate that slices are appropriately sized
- Identify migration ordering that maintains system stability

**Common AI Questions:**
- "What would be the implications of combining these two slices?"
- "Are there any technical conflicts between these slice designs?"
- "Is this slice appropriately sized, or should it be split further?"
- "What foundation work is needed before this slice can begin?"
- "Does this migration slice leave the system in a working state?"

#### Output Format
**For architecture-level planning**, create:
*Slice Plan* (`user/architecture/nnn-slices.{name}.md`, sharing parent document's base index):

**For project-level planning**, create:
*Slice Plan* (`user/architecture/003-slices.{project}.md`):

*Note: {tsi} in template below is {tentative-slice-index}.  The first slice should receive the index of the plan itself which matches the plan's architectural initiative index (ex: 100, 120, etc).  Additional slices receive consecutive index values (101, 102, etc)*

**Slice plan template** (see `file-naming-conventions.md` for the canonical YAML schema reference):
```yaml
---
docType: slice-plan
parent: {path to parent document}
project: {project}
dateCreated: YYYYMMDD
dateUpdated: YYYYMMDD
status: not_started

## Notes
- Key decisions made during planning
- Alternative approaches considered
- Future work planned for later phases
- Open questions for later phases

Include only the slice categories that apply. A restructuring effort may have no feature slices. A greenfield project may have no migration slices.

## Future Work
Items discovered during slice design, task breakdown, or implementation that are out of scope for the current plan but worth tracking. Add entries here as they arise — they serve as a backlog for future planning cycles.

Format matches the slice entries above (numbered, checkbox, name, description, dependencies, effort), but number future work slices restarting at 1.

#### Success Criteria
Phase 3 is complete when:
- [ ] All work from the parent document is categorized into appropriate slice types
- [ ] Slices are appropriately sized (coherent units with clear boundaries)
- [ ] Dependencies between slices are clearly identified
- [ ] Implementation order is logical and accounts for risk and enablement
- [ ] Each slice has clear success criteria
