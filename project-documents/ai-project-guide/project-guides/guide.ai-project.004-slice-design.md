#### Summary
This guide provides instructions for Phase 4: Slice Design (Low-Level Design). This phase takes an approved slice from a slice plan and creates a detailed technical design that can be converted into implementable tasks. The slice design serves as the technical blueprint for Phase 5 (Task Breakdown) and Phase 6 (Implementation).

Slice designs are created for slices defined in either a project-level slice plan or an architecture-level slice plan. The process is the same; what varies is which documents provide context.

#### Inputs and Outputs

**Inputs:**

Slice design typically uses two levels of input:

* **Strategic context** — the document that provides the big-picture view of where this slice fits in the overall system. This is one of:
  * Project HLD (`user/architecture/050-arch.hld-{project}.md`)
  * Architecture document (`user/architecture/nnn-arch.{name}.md`)

* **Working input** — the slice plan entry that defines what this specific slice should accomplish.  This is one of:
  * Architecture-level slice plan (`user/architecture/nnn-slices.{name}.md`)
  * Slice description provided directly by the Project Manager

The strategic context tells the agent *why this slice exists and how it relates to the whole*. The working input tells the agent *what this slice needs to deliver*. Both are typically needed; the strategic context may be skipped for simple or self-contained slices at the Project Manager's discretion.

**Additional inputs (as applicable):**
* `guide.ai-project.process` (process guide)
* `guide.ai-project.004-slice-design` (this document)
* Relevant tool guides from `ai-project-guide/tool-guides/{tool}/`
* Framework guides from `ai-project-guide/framework-guides/{framework}/`
* Prior slice designs if this slice depends on them

**Output:**
* Slice design document: `user/slices/nnn-slice.{slice-name}.md`
  * `nnn` shares the initiative's base index (for the first slice) or increments from it (for subsequent slices). See `file-naming-conventions.md`.

#### Core Principles

##### Technical Completeness
The slice design should contain enough technical detail that:
- Tasks can be created without guessing implementation approaches
- Integration points with other slices are clearly defined
- Technology choices are explicit and justified
- Success criteria are measurable and specific

##### Slice Independence
Each slice design should:
- Minimize dependencies on other slices
- Define clean interfaces where dependencies exist
- Be implementable and testable in isolation
- Leave the system in a working state when complete
- Deliver meaningful value (user-facing, developer-facing, or architectural)

##### Implementation Readiness
The design should bridge the gap between high-level architecture and concrete tasks:
- Include specific technical decisions
- Reference exact tools, libraries, and patterns
- Provide mockups or detailed specifications for UI components (if applicable)
- Define data schemas and API contracts (if applicable)

##### Appropriate Detail
- Include sections that are relevant to this slice. Omit sections that don't apply.
- A migration slice may not need UI Specifications or API Contracts. A UI slice may not need Database Schema. Use judgment.
- The template below is comprehensive; it is not a mandatory checklist. Every section marked "(if applicable)" should be included only when relevant.

#### Slice Design Structure

##### Document Template

The canonical template is a file, not this prose:
`project-documents/ai-project-guide/project-guides/templates/slice-design.md`.
Copy it to `user/slices/nnn-slice.{slice-name}.md`, substitute every `{placeholder}`, and delete the marker comments. See `file-naming-conventions.md` for the YAML schema.

The template is also the section schema, and `scripts/validate-slice-design` enforces it:

- A heading followed by `<!-- required -->` must appear in the finished document at the same level with the same text. The template is the only place that decides which sections these are.
- A heading followed by `<!-- optional: ... -->` may be omitted entirely when its stated condition applies. Omit it; do not fill it with boilerplate.
- Unmarked level-3 headings are guidance. Rename, replace, or drop them as the design needs. Extra sections are allowed.

Run the validator before declaring Phase 4 complete:

```bash
./project-documents/ai-project-guide/scripts/validate-slice-design user/slices/nnn-slice.{slice-name}.md
```

It prints `PASS` or `FAIL` with the missing headings and exits non-zero on failure. It checks structure only; content quality is still the Design Review Checklist below.

**`review: none` is a Project Manager decision, never an agent's.** Context Forge treats `review: none` in slice-design frontmatter as a review-exempt declaration: it unconditionally clears every slice-scoped review gate (slice review, task review, code review) for that slice. Agents must not add this field, must not run `cf check --set-review-none`, and must not carry it over when using an earlier slice design as a format reference. Write frontmatter from the template, not by copying a sibling document. If `cf next` reports that a review is required before proceeding, stop and tell the Project Manager, or run the review through the project's established review process. Never edit frontmatter to clear a gate.

#### Slice Design Patterns

##### Feature Slices
For slices that deliver new functionality (UI, API, or full-stack):

**UI-focused:**
- Component hierarchy, page/route structure
- State management patterns (local vs global)
- Interaction patterns and user flows
- Design specifications, responsive breakpoints, accessibility

**API-focused:**
- Endpoint or tool interface design with request/response formats
- Business logic and validation rules
- Data layer (schema, queries, caching)
- External service integration

**Full-stack:**
- Integration strategy between frontend and backend
- Shared types or interfaces across layers
- Error handling and user feedback across the stack

##### Migration / Refactoring Slices
For slices that extract, move, or restructure existing code:

**Code Extraction:**
- Identify all source files being extracted and their destination
- Map every consumer (import) of the extracted code
- Define the update strategy: do consumers change their imports, or do re-exports maintain backward compatibility?
- Verify that the extracted code has no dependencies on the source environment (e.g., Electron APIs, browser globals)

**Storage Migration:**
- Old storage mechanism and new storage mechanism
- Data format mapping (if schema changes)
- One-time migration strategy for existing data
- Concurrent access considerations (if multiple processes may read/write)

**Dependency Restructuring:**
- Before and after dependency graphs
- Build configuration changes
- Impact on existing test suites

**Key constraint:** Every migration slice must leave the application in a working state. The design must explicitly describe how this is ensured — typically by verifying that all consumers are updated within the same slice.

#### Common Design Decisions

##### Technology Integration
When incorporating new tools or libraries:
- Justify the choice based on slice requirements
- Document configuration and setup needs
- Identify potential conflicts with existing tech stack

##### Working with Dependencies
When a slice depends on another slice:
- Define exact interface requirements
- Specify fallback behavior if dependency fails or isn't available
- Document contract expectations
- Plan for independent testing approaches

When depending on foundation work:
- Verify foundation work is complete and stable
- Document specific foundation features needed
- Identify gaps that might need additional foundation work

#### Quality Assurance

##### Design Review Checklist
Before approving a slice design:
- [ ] Value is clearly articulated (user, developer, or architectural)
- [ ] Technical scope is well-defined and bounded
- [ ] Dependencies are identified and realistic
- [ ] Architecture supports the intended functionality
- [ ] Success criteria are specific and measurable
- [ ] Verification walkthrough provides concrete, runnable confirmation of delivery
- [ ] Integration points are clearly defined
- [ ] Migration slices explicitly ensure the system remains working
- [ ] Irrelevant template sections are omitted rather than filled with boilerplate
- [ ] `scripts/validate-slice-design` prints PASS for the document
- [ ] Project Manager approves the design

##### Common Issues to Avoid
- **Scope Creep:** Keep slice focused on its defined value delivery
- **Hidden Dependencies:** Ensure all dependencies are explicit
- **Over-Engineering:** Design for current needs, not hypothetical futures
- **Under-Specification:** Include enough detail for task creation
- **Integration Gaps:** Clearly define how this slice connects to others
- **Template Stuffing:** Don't fill in sections just because they exist in the template; omit what doesn't apply
- **Broken Intermediate State:** Migration slices that leave consumers pointing at moved code without updating imports

#### Success Criteria
Phase 4 is complete when:
- [ ] Slice design document exists with proper frontmatter and passes `scripts/validate-slice-design`
- [ ] Technical approach is detailed enough for task creation
- [ ] Dependencies and integration points are clearly defined
- [ ] Relevant specifications are included (UI, API, migration plan, etc.)
- [ ] Success criteria are specific and measurable
- [ ] Migration slices describe how the system remains working throughout
- [ ] Project Manager and Architect approve the design

#### Summary
The slice design serves as the technical contract for implementation and the reference point for all subsequent development work on this slice.
