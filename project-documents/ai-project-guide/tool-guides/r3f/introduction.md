# React Three Fiber (R3F)

React Three Fiber is the standard integration library for Three.js in React applications, enabling declarative 3D scene construction using React components. Below is a technical guide optimized for AI/developer use cases.

---

## Core Installation & Setup  

```bash
npm install three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei
```
- **Three.js**: Base 3D engine dependency[1][6]  
- **@react-three/fiber**: React reconciler for Three.js[1][5]  
- **@react-three/drei**: Helper components (optional but recommended)[3][4]  

---

## Next.js Specific Configuration  

### 1. Package Transpilation  
```javascript
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  transpilePackages: ['three', '@react-three/fiber', '@react-three/drei'][6][7]
}
```

### 2. Dynamic Import (SSR Handling)  
```javascript
// components/Scene.js
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const Canvas = dynamic(
  () => import('@react-three/fiber').then((mod) => mod.Canvas),
  { ssr: false }
)
```
- Required to avoid WebGL context issues during server-side rendering[4][7]  

### 3. Asset Pipeline  
```javascript
// public/static/ models/robot.glb
import { useGLTF } from '@react-three/drei'

function Model() {
  const { nodes } = useGLTF('/static/models/robot.glb')
  return <primitive object={nodes.Robot} />
}
```
- Static assets must reside in `public/` directory[4][7]  

---


## Key Architectural Patterns  

### Scene Composition  
```jsx
<Canvas camera={{ position: [0, 0, 5], fov: 50 }}>
  <ambientLight intensity={0.5} />
  <pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} />
  <mesh rotation={[0, 0, 0]}>
    <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
    <meshStandardMaterial color="hotpink" />
  </mesh>
  <OrbitControls />
</Canvas>
```
- JSX maps directly to Three.js constructors (`<mesh>` → `new THREE.Mesh()`)[1][5]  
- `args` prop handles constructor parameters[5]  

---

## Deployment Considerations  

| Issue | Solution |  
|-------|----------|  
| Missing GLB Models | Verify asset paths in production build[4] |  
| WebGL Context Errors | Use `next/dynamic` with SSR disabled[4][7] |  
| Three.js Version Conflicts | Lock Three.js to specific version[6][7] |  
| Next.js 15 Compatibility | Use `@react-three/fiber@alpha` or downgrade to Next 14[7] |  

---

## Performance Optimization  

```jsx
import { Suspense } from 'react'
import { Html, useProgress } from '@react-three/drei'

function Loader() {
  const { progress } = useProgress()
  return <Html center>{progress}% loaded</Html>
}

<Suspense fallback={<Loader />}>
  <ExpensiveModel />
</Suspense>
```
- Leverages React Suspense for async asset loading[3][6]  
- `useProgress` hook provides loading metrics[4]  

---

This configuration provides a foundation for integrating Three.js visualizations into React/Next.js applications while addressing common deployment challenges. The component-based architecture enables composition of complex 3D scenes while maintaining React's state management capabilities[1][5][6].
