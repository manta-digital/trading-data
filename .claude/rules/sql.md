description: SQL coding standards for PostgreSQL, pgvector, and TimescaleDB. Use when writing queries, migrations, schema definitions, database functions, or any code that connects to a database — including test fixtures and runners. Covers naming, indexing, query optimization, extension-specific patterns, and production-database protection.

### SQL and PostgreSQL Development Rules

#### Query Style & Formatting

- UPPERCASE SQL keywords: `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, not `select`
- Lowercase table and column names with underscores: `user_accounts`
- Indent multi-line queries consistently (2 or 4 spaces)
- One column per line in SELECT for readability
- Leading commas in SELECT lists for easier modification
- Meaningful table aliases, avoid single letters

#### Query Optimization

- Always use EXPLAIN ANALYZE for performance tuning
- Create indexes for WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY columns
- Use partial indexes for filtered queries
- Prefer JOIN over subqueries when possible
- LIMIT queries during development testing
- Avoid SELECT * in production code
- Use EXISTS instead of COUNT for existence checks

#### PostgreSQL Best Practices

- Use appropriate data types: JSONB over JSON, TEXT over VARCHAR
- UUID for distributed IDs, SERIAL/BIGSERIAL for single-node
- Check constraints for data validation
- Foreign keys with appropriate CASCADE options
- Use transactions for multi-statement operations
- RETURNING clause to get modified data
- CTEs (WITH clauses) for complex queries

#### Naming & Schema Design

- Singular table names: `user` not `users`
- Primary key as `id` or `table_name_id`
- Foreign keys as `referenced_table_id`
- Boolean columns prefixed with `is_` or `has_`
- Timestamps: `created_at`, `updated_at` with timezone
- Use schemas to organize related tables
- Version control migrations with sequential numbering

#### Security & Safety

- Always use parameterized queries, never string concatenation
- GRANT minimum required privileges
- Use ROW LEVEL SECURITY for multi-tenant apps
- Sanitize all user input
- Prepared statements for repeated queries
- Connection pooling with appropriate limits
- Set statement_timeout for long-running queries

#### Production Database Protection

Distilled from a real production incident (test fixture truncated prod metadata)
and its recovery. These are deterministic-first: prefer a control the server or a
test can enforce over a rule someone must remember.

- **Split connection roles.** The application role gets DML only — no TRUNCATE
  (a separate grantable privilege), no DDL, no ownership, read-only on the
  migration ledger. Migrations and maintenance use a separate role/URL supplied
  only when doing that work. With this split, a test that leaks production
  credentials dies on `permission denied` instead of destroying tables.
- **Tests never read the production URL variable.** Test tiers use a dedicated
  test variable and throwaway databases created by the fixture itself. A fixture
  that issues TRUNCATE/DROP/ALTER/DELETE may only target a database it created.
  "Unit" is a directory name, not a property — nothing stops a file under
  `test/unit/` from opening a connection.
- **Enforce it mechanically, per tier.** A guard test scans every test file for
  reads of the production variable and fails on offenders (ratchet with a
  shrink-only allowlist if legacy readers exist). The scan must be
  multiline-aware — `os.environ.get(\n "VAR")` defeats a per-line grep.
  The absence of a guard in a tier is not evidence of safety.
- **Never inject a whole `.env` into a child process.** Pass an explicit list of
  named variables. A runner built to fix a parsing problem must not widen
  credential scope as a side effect.
- **`TRUNCATE ... CASCADE` destroys the FK closure, not the named tables.**
  Enumerate the closure before any CASCADE against a shared database.
- **Destructive and maintenance tooling (restore, rechunk, repair) takes its
  DB URL from an explicit caller argument** — never from ambient environment
  inside the tool. A restore aimed by an unset variable is the same failure
  mode the tool exists to repair. Refuse to run when the target does not look
  like the database the operation expects (verify signature tables/rows first).
- **Restore-by-replay heals the ledger, not the catalog.** Objects dropped while
  their creating migration is still recorded are invisible to replay. A restore
  tool must diff the live catalog against expectations; and after any incident,
  verify derived objects (matviews, continuous aggregates) by **content parity
  against source**, never by catalog presence — an object created or interrupted
  mid-incident is presumed damaged, and for an empty derived object,
  drop-and-recreate from its migration beats in-place repair.
- **Size backup priority by what cannot be re-derived** from providers or raw
  data, not by the last incident's blast radius.
- **Protect the host from runaway sessions:** `vm.overcommit_memory=2` on
  dedicated Postgres hosts so allocation failure hits the statement, not the
  OOM killer hitting the postmaster. For bulk rebuilds, run a watchdog that
  `pg_cancel_backend`s the working backend when free memory crosses a floor —
  cancellation releases memory instantly; the OOM killer takes the cluster.
  Note `work_mem` does not bound extension-internal allocations (e.g.
  TimescaleDB cagg materialization).
- **After a client-side timeout, `pg_cancel_backend` the server side** before
  running anything else; client disconnect does not cancel the backend.

#### pgvector Specific

- Use `vector` type for embeddings
- Create HNSW or IVFFlat indexes for similarity search
- Normalize vectors before storage when needed
- Use `<->` for L2 distance, `<#>` for inner product
- Batch insert embeddings for performance
- Consider dimension reduction for large vectors

#### TimescaleDB Specific

- Create hypertables for time-series data
- Use appropriate chunk intervals (typically 1 week to 1 month)
- Continuous aggregates for common queries
- Compression policies for older data
- Retention policies to manage data lifecycle
- Use time_bucket() for time-based aggregations
- Data retention policies with drop_chunks()

#### Performance & Monitoring

- Index foreign keys and commonly filtered columns
- VACUUM and ANALYZE regularly
- Monitor pg_stat_statements for slow queries
- Use connection pooling (PgBouncer/pgpool)
- Partition large tables by date or ID range
- Avoid excessive indexes (write performance cost)
- Use COPY for bulk inserts

#### Migrations & Maintenance

- Always reversible migrations when possible
- Test migrations on copy of production data
- Use IF NOT EXISTS for idempotent operations
- Document breaking changes
- Backup before structural changes
- Zero-downtime migrations with careful planning
